h2. MacRuby

For someone like me, who has been tinkering around with Objective-C, "MacRuby":http://macruby.org/ is awesome. MacRuby is Ruby 1.9 ported to directly interface with core Mac OS X technologies. What does that mean? Well lets say you make the string "Bob" with MacRuby. "Bob".class would return NSMutableString. Meaning you just created a core Objective-C object directly with Ruby.

HotCocoa is a bunch of Ruby mappings to Cocoa classes. Think of it like Ruby short hand to make Cocoa classes. It makes creating a simple application easy as 1 2 3.

1. win = window
2. b   = button
3. win << b

Run that code in macirb or HotConsole
