Creating a Jekyll blog is both fun and easy. I was amazed how easy it was to get started and get something up and running in a couple minutes!

To get started you'll want to download jekyll and all it's components at: "github.com/mojombo/jekyll":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/tree/master

First find out which fonts you can use:

{% highlight bash %}
jpoz$ identify -list font
{% endhighlight %}
